A simple browser-based code editor, focused on programming on mobile devices. It runs and saves locally on your device.

## Background
I often write or run code while traveling on a bus, so this is a simple editor tailored to my needs. It currently supports only single-file HTML/CSS/JS, intended for quick prototyping.

A bonus feature is a floating keyboard with programming-related keys (including indent/shift-indent and left/right arrows), reducing the need to switch between pages on the mobile keyboard.

Installation is not required—it works in the browser—but it can be installed as a PWA using the mobile browser's `Add to Home Screen` option.
