A simple browser-based code editor, meant for my usage. Live at [https://me.cmdr2.org/carbon](https://me.cmdr2.org/carbon)

I often write or run code while traveling in a bus. So this is a simple editor that's tailored to my liking.

A bonus feature is a floating keyboard with programming-related characters, that avoids the need to keep switching pages on the mobile keyboard.

Doesn't require installation (works in the browser), but can be installed as a PWA using the mobile browser's `Add to Home Screen` option.
