A simple browser-based code editor, focused on programming on mobile devices. Runs and saves locally on the device.

## Background
I often write or run code while traveling in a bus. So this is a simple editor that's tailored to my liking. It currently works only for single file HTML/CSS/JS, meant for quick prototyping.

A bonus feature is a floating keyboard with programming-related keys (including indent/shift-indent and left/right arrows), that avoids the need to keep switching pages on the mobile keyboard.

It does not require installation (works in the browser), but it can be installed as a PWA using the mobile browser's `Add to Home Screen` option.
