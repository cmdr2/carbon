A simple browser-based code editor, meant for my usage.

I often write or run code while sitting in a bus. So this is a simple editor that's tailored to my liking.

A bonus feature is a floating keyboard with programming-related characters, that avoids the need to keep switching pages on the mobile keyboard.
